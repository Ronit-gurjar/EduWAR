## Introduction
This project was made as a Minor project in my B.tech 3rd year.

## Idea behind the Project

The education system all over the world was only following traditional instructor-led 
teaching approach. Integrating Augmented Reality in education can enrich and bring in 
benefits for educational institutions, educators as well as learners enriching the entire 
learning experience.

Using AR in the classroom can turn an ordinary class into an engaging 
experience. AR technology provides virtual examples and adds gaming elements to 
support textbook materials. As a result, classes become more interactive. AR helps 
students better remember the information they've just learned.
Students with weak imagination sometimes stays behind as they could not 
understand how a “specific thing” is required for “specific process” resulting in poor 
grades. 

The EduWAR app focuses mainly on helping the student understand those 
“things” with the use of well-rendered and well-defined 3D models. 
 The app functions as a puzzle game in which the students are given some special 
cards which when seen from the camera shows a Augmented 3D model for a specific card. 
Each card is labelled based on particular components of computer architecture and same 
goes for their respective 3D models.
 The cards are to be placed in a specific manner to complete the computer 
system, in case of wrong placements or combinations of cards the system will throw errors 
with explanation so that the student can understand the next steps, hence learning a 
Complex subject in a fun way.
The App consists of a ‘Help’ option which consists of a link for the target 
images for the cards and also instructions on how to utilize the app efficiently.
